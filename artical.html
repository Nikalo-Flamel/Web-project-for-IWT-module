                <h3>Guitar</h3>
                <p>
                    The guitar is a fretted musical instrument that typically has six strings. 
                    It is held flat against the player's body and played by strumming or plucking the
                     strings with the dominant hand, while simultaneously pressing the strings against
                      frets with the fingers of the opposite hand. A plectrum or individual finger picks
                       may be used to strike the strings. The sound of the guitar is projected either 
                       acoustically, by means of a resonant chamber on the instrument, or amplified 
                       by an electronic pickup and an amplifier.The guitar is classified as a chordophone – meaning 
                       the sound is produced by a vibrating string stretched between two fixed points. 
                       Historically, a guitar was constructed from wood with its strings made of catgut.
                        Steel guitar strings were introduced near the end of the nineteenth century in 
                        the United States; nylon strings came in the 1940s. The guitar's ancestors 
                        include the gittern, the vihuela, the four-course Renaissance guitar, and the 
                        five-course baroque guitar, all of which contributed to the development of the 
                        modern six-string instrument.

                </p>
                <p>There are three main types of modern guitar: the classical guitar 
                    (Spanish guitar/nylon-string guitar); the steel-string acoustic 
                    guitar; and the Hawaiian guitar (played across the player's lap). 
                    Traditional acoustic guitars include the flat top guitar (typically with a large sound hole)
                     or an archtop guitar, which is sometimes called a "jazz guitar". The tone of an acoustic 
                     guitar is produced by the strings' vibration, amplified by the hollow body of the guitar, 
                     which acts as a resonating chamber. The classical Spanish guitar is often played as a solo 
                     instrument using a comprehensive fingerstyle technique where each string is plucked individually
                      by the player's fingers, as opposed to being strummed. The term "finger-picking" can also refer 
                      to a specific tradition of folk, blues, bluegrass, and country guitar playing in the United States.

                <h3>Saxophone</h3>
                <p>
                    The saxophone is a type of single-reed woodwind instrument with a conical body, 
                    usually made of brass. As with all single-reed instruments, sound is produced when
                     a cane reed on a mouthpiece vibrates to produce a sound wave inside the instrument's 
                     body. The pitch is controlled by opening and closing holes in the body to change the
                      effective length of the tube.The holes are closed by leather pads attached to keys 
                      operated by the player. Saxophones are made in various sizes and are almost always treated 
                      as transposing instruments. Saxophone players are called saxophonists.

                    The saxophone is used in a wide range of musical styles including classical 
                    music (such as concert bands, chamber music, solo repertoire, and occasionally orchestras), 
                    military bands, marching bands, jazz (such as big bands and jazz combos), and contemporary music. 
                    The saxophone is also used as a solo and melody instrument or as a member of a horn section in some 
                    styles of rock and roll and popular music.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The saxophone was invented by the Belgian instrument maker Adolphe Sax in the early 
                    1840s and was patented on 28 June 1846. Sax invented two groups of seven instruments 
                    each—one group contained instruments in C and F, and the other group contained instruments 
                    in B♭ and E♭. The B♭ and E♭ instruments soon became dominant and most saxophones encountered
                     today are from this series. Instruments from the series pitched in C and F never gained a foothold
                      and constituted only a small percentage of instruments made by Sax. High Pitch (also marked "H" or "HP") 
                      saxophones tuned sharper than the (concert) A = 440 Hz standard were produced into the early twentieth
                       century for sonic qualities suited for outdoor use, but are not playable to modern tuning and are considered
                        obsolete. Low Pitch (also marked "L" or "LP") saxophones are equivalent in tuning to modern instruments.
                         C soprano and C melody saxophones were produced for the casual market as parlor instruments during the 
                         early twentieth century, and saxophones in F were introduced during the late 1920s but never gained acceptance. 
                         The modern saxophone family consists entirely of B♭ and E♭ instruments.

                <h3>Flute</h3>
                <p>
                    The flute is a family of musical instruments in the woodwind group. Unlike woodwind instruments with reeds, 
                    a flute is an aerophone or reedless wind instrument that produces its sound from the flow of air across an 
                    opening. According to the instrument classification of Hornbostel–Sachs, flutes are categorized as edge-blown
                     aerophones.[1] A musician who plays the flute can be referred to as a flute player, flautist, flutist or, less
                      commonly, fluter or flutenist.

                    Flutes are the earliest known identifiable musical instruments, as paleolithic examples with hand-bored holes have been found.
                    A number of flutes dating to about 43,000 to 35,000 years ago have been found in the Swabian Jura region of present-day Germany.
                    These flutes demonstrate that a developed musical tradition existed from the earliest period of modern human presence in Europe.
                    While the oldest flutes currently known were found in Europe, Asia too has a long history with the instrument that has continued 
                    into the present day. In China, a playable bone flute was discovered, dated approximately 9000 years old. The Americas also had an 
                    ancient flute culture, with instruments found in Caral, Peru, dating back 5000 years and Labrador dating back approximately 7500 
                    years
                </p>

                <p>Historians have found the bamboo flute has a long history as well, especially in China and India. Flutes have 
                    been discovered in historical records and artworks starting in the Zhou dynasty. The oldest written sources
                     reveal the Chinese were using the kuan (a reed instrument) and hsio (or xiao, an end-blown flute, often of bamboo)
                      in the 12th-11th centuries B.C., followed by the chi (or ch'ih) in the 9th century B.C. and the yüeh in the
                       8th century B.C. Of these, the chi is the oldest documented cross flute or transverse flute, and was made 
                       from bamboo

                <h3>Piano</h3>
                <p>
                    The piano is an acoustic, stringed musical instrument invented in Italy by Bartolomeo Cristofori
                     around the year 1700 (the exact year is uncertain), in which the strings are struck by wooden hammers
                      that are coated with a softer material (modern hammers are covered with dense wool felt; some early 
                      pianos used leather). It is played using a keyboard, which is a row of keys (small levers) that the performer
                       presses down or strikes with the fingers and thumbs of both hands to cause the hammers to strike the strings.

                    The word "piano" is a shortened form of pianoforte, the Italian term for the early 1700s versions of the instrument,
                     which in turn derives from gravicembalo col piano e forte (key cymbal with quieter and louder) and fortepiano. 
                     The Italian musical terms piano and forte indicate "soft" and "loud" respectively,in this context referring to
                      the variations in volume (i.e., loudness) produced in response to a pianist's touch or pressure on the keys: the 
                      greater the velocity of a key press, the greater the force of the hammer hitting the strings, and the louder the 
                      sound of the note produced and the stronger the attack. The name was created as a contrast to harpsichord, a musical 
                      instrument that does not allow variation in volume; compared to the harpsichord, the first fortepianos in the 1700s
                       had a quieter sound and smaller dynamic range.
                </p>

                <p>A piano usually has a protective wooden case surrounding the soundboard and metal strings, which are strung under 
                    great tension on a heavy metal frame. Pressing one or more keys on the piano's keyboard causes a wooden or plastic 
                    hammer (typically padded with firm felt) to strike the strings. The hammer rebounds from the strings, and the strings 
                    continue to vibrate at their resonant frequency.[4] These vibrations are transmitted through a bridge to a soundboard 
                    that amplifies by more efficiently coupling the acoustic energy to the air. When the key is released, a damper stops 
                    the strings' vibration, ending the sound. Notes can be sustained, even when the keys are released by the fingers and 
                    thumbs, by the use of pedals at the base of the instrument. The sustain pedal enables pianists to play musical passages 
                    that would otherwise be impossible, such as sounding a 10-note chord in the lower register and then, while this chord is 
                    being continued with the sustain pedal, shifting both hands to the treble range to play a melody and arpeggios over the
                     top of this sustained chord. Unlike the pipe organ and harpsichord, two major keyboard instruments widely used before 
                     the piano, the piano allows gradations of volume and tone according to how forcefully or softly a performer presses 
                     or strikes the keys

                <h3>Violin</h3>
                <p>
                    The violin, sometimes known as a fiddle, is a wooden chordophone (string instrument) in the violin family. 
                    Most violins have a hollow wooden body. It is the smallest and thus highest-pitched instrument (soprano) in 
                    the family in regular use.[a] The violin typically has four strings, usually tuned in perfect fifths with 
                    notes G3, D4, A4, E5, and is most commonly played by drawing a bow across its strings. It can also be played 
                    by plucking the strings with the fingers (pizzicato) and, in specialized cases, by striking the strings with 
                    the wooden side of the bow (col legno).

                    Violins are important instruments in a wide variety of musical genres. They are most prominent in the Western
                     classical tradition, both in ensembles (from chamber music to orchestras) and as solo instruments. Violins are
                      also important in many varieties of folk music, including country music, bluegrass music, and in jazz. Electric 
                      violins with solid bodies and piezoelectric pickups are used in some forms of rock music and jazz fusion, with 
                      the pickups plugged into instrument amplifiers and speakers to produce sound. The violin has come to be incorporated 
                      in many non-Western music cultures, including Indian music and Iranian music. The name fiddle is often used 
                      regardless of the type of music played on it.
                </p>

                <p>The violin was first known in 16th-century Italy, with some further modifications occurring in the 18th and 19th
                     centuries to give the instrument a more powerful sound and projection. In Europe, it served as the basis for
                      the development of other stringed instruments used in Western classical music, such as the viola.

                    Violinists and collectors particularly prize the fine historical instruments made by the Stradivari, 
                    Guarneri, Guadagnini and Amati families from the 16th to the 18th century in Brescia and Cremona (Italy) 
                    and by Jacob Stainer in Austria. According to their reputation, the quality of their sound has defied attempts 
                    to explain or equal it, though this belief is disputed. Great numbers of instruments have come from the hands
                     of less famous makers, as well as still greater numbers of mass-produced commercial "trade violins" coming from 
                     cottage industries in places such as Saxony, Bohemia, and Mirecourt. Many of these trade instruments were formerly 
                     sold by Sears, Roebuck and Co. and other mass merchandisers.

                <h3>Trumpet</h3>
                <p>
                    The trumpet is a brass instrument commonly used in classical and jazz ensembles. The trumpet group ranges 
                    from the piccolo trumpet with the highest register in the brass family, to the bass trumpet, which is pitched 
                    one octave below the standard B♭ or C Trumpet.

                    Trumpet-like instruments have historically been used as signalling devices in battle or hunting, with 
                    examples dating back to at least 1500 BC. They began to be used as musical instruments only in the late 
                    14th or early 15th century.[1] Trumpets are used in art music styles, for instance in orchestras, concert
                     bands, and jazz ensembles, as well as in popular music. They are played by blowing air through nearly-closed 
                     lips (called the player's embouchure), producing a "buzzing" sound that starts a standing wave vibration in the
                      air column inside the instrument.[2] Since the late 15th century, trumpets have primarily been constructed of

                <p>There are many distinct types of trumpet, with the most common being pitched in B♭ (a transposing instrument),
                     having a tubing length of about 1.48 m (4 ft 10 in). Early trumpets did not provide means to change the length 
                     of tubing, whereas modern instruments generally have three (or sometimes four) valves in order to change their 
                     pitch. There are eight combinations of three valves, making seven different tubing lengths, with the third valve 
                     sometimes used as an alternate fingering equivalent to the 1–2 combination. Most trumpets have valves of the 
                     piston type, while some have the rotary type. The use of rotary-valved trumpets is more common in orchestral
                      settings (especially in German and German-style orchestras), although this practice varies by country. Each 
                      valve, when engaged, increases the length of tubing, lowering the pitch of the instrument. A musician who plays 
                      the trumpet is called a trumpet player or trumpeter

                <h3>Keyboard</h3>
                <p>
                    A musical keyboard is the set of adjacent depressible levers or keys on a musical instrument. 
                    Keyboards typically contain keys for playing the twelve notes of the Western musical scale, 
                    with a combination of larger, longer keys and smaller, shorter keys that repeats at the interval 
                    of an octave. Depressing a key on the keyboard makes the instrument produce sounds—either by 
                    mechanically striking a string or tine (acoustic and electric piano, clavichord), plucking a string 
                    (harpsichord), causing air to flow through a pipe organ, striking a bell (carillon), or, on electric 
                    and electronic keyboards, completing a circuit (Hammond organ, digital piano, synthesizer). Since the 
                    most commonly encountered keyboard instrument is the piano, the keyboard layout is often referred to 
                    as the piano keyboard.

                <P>
                    Simpler electronic keyboards have switches under each key. Depressing a key connects a circuit, 
                    which triggers tone generation. Most keyboards use a keyboard matrix circuit, in which 8 rows and 
                    8 columns of wires cross — thus, 16 wires can provide 8 × 8 = 64 crossings, which the keyboard controller 
                    scans to determine which key was pressed.[4] The problem with this system is that it provides only a crude
                     binary on/off signal for each key. Better electronic keyboards employ two sets of slightly offset switches 
                     for each key. By determining the timing between the activation of the first and second switches, the velocity 
                     of a key press can be determined, greatly improving the performance dynamic of a keyboard. The best electronic
                      keyboards have dedicated circuits for each key, providing polyphonic aftertouch.

                        Advanced electronic keyboards may provide hundreds of key touch levels[5] and have 88 keys, as most pianos do.

                <h3>Drum Kit</h3>
                <p>
                    A drum set – also called a drum kit, trap set (an abbreviation of the word "contraption")
                     or simply drums – is a collection of drums, cymbals and other percussion instruments, which 
                     are set up on stands to be played by a single player,[2] with drumsticks held in both hands 
                     and the feet operating pedals that control the hi-hat cymbal and the beater for the bass drum. 
                     A drum kit consists of a mix of drums (categorized classically as membranophones, Hornbostel-Sachs 
                     high-level classification 2) and idiophones ⁠– ⁠most significantly cymbals, but can also include the 
                     woodblock and cowbell (classified as Hornbostel-Sachs high-level classification 1).[3] In the 2020s,
                      some kits also include electronic instruments (Hornbostel-Sachs classification 53). Also, both hybrid
                       (mixing acoustic instruments and electronic drums) and entirely electronic kits are used.
